## In January 2022 I began working on a video game to propose to my then girlfriend of three years. I had decided early on in the relationship that this is how I would propose, and after several months of work I proposed on May 29th, 2022 and she said, "Yes!" In the picture above, you can see her playing it mere minutes before I asked her to marry me. 

The game was called, "The Happiest I Had Ever Been," and had her play as me through the day I originally asked her out in 2019. After the beginning scene it went through a few animated cutscenes I had made and then to a screen where it asked her to marry me. Unfortunately, the game is lost to time as my laptop containing the sourcecode was bricked shortly after proposing. A few things were backed up though, and in this repository you can find all of the songs that were used in the game, which I wrote and recorded myself besides "Married Life." You can additionally find a few concept art images. 

The game had been written using the Godot game engine and Aseprite to make the artwork. The game's source code was written in GDScript, which is a Python derivative.
