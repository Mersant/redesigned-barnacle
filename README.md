In January 2022 I began working on a video game to propose to my then girlfriend of three years. I had decided early on in the relationship that this is how I would propose, and after several months of work I proposed on May 29th, 2022 and she said, "Yes!" In the picture above, you can see her playing it mere minutes before I asked her to marry me. 

The game was called, "The Happiest I Had Ever Been," and had her play as me through the day I originally asked her out in 2019. After the beginning scene it went through a few animated cutscenes I had made and then to a screen where it asked her to marry me. Unfortunately, the game is lost to time as my laptop containing the sourcecode was bricked shortly after proposing. (A benefit of this tragedy is, I suppose, my newfound commitment to backing up my code on GitHub) A few things were backed up though, and in this repository you can find all of the songs that were used in the game, which I wrote and recorded myself besides "Married Life." You can additionally find a few concept art images. I sometimes fear our marriage itself will be the only "real" testament to its existence, but hopefully the contents of this repo will give you an idea of what it was like to play. :-)

The game had been written using the Godot game engine and Aseprite to make the artwork. The game's source code was written in GDScript, which is a Python derivative.

## What you'll find in this repository
This repository serves as a backup for what little I was able to recover of the project. I plan to remake the game at some point, so it will be useful to have easy access to the songs, art style etc. As I remake the game, more will be added to this repo.
